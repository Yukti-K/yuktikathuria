        <p> I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and I am advised by <a href="https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory/muge-capan">Muge Capan</a>. My research is focused on understanding health inequities that prevent vulnerable populations from timely access to healthcare and lead to certain communities experiencing a disproportionate burden of sickness/illness/death. My work involves developing analytical and computational models to risk stratify disadvantaged populations for resource allocation/targeted interventions.
